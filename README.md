# car-overtaking-animation
c++/openGL 2d animation

The first project I ever did using the freeglut library.

Some screenshots of the animation:

http://prntscr.com/l83oa8 (the green car stoping at the red light)

http://prntscr.com/l83p1d (the green car continuing its jorney)

The user can pause/play or restart the animation by using the buttons in the boom-right corner or by using the keys shown on the screen.

At the start of the program, the user is asked for the FPS rate so that he can control the speed of the animation. This way the program runs independent of the system it is executed on(it runs at the same speed no matter how fast the user's computer is)
